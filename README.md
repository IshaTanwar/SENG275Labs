Software Testing Techniques

1. Lab 01: JUnit
2. Lab 02: TDD
3. Lab 03: Boundary Testing (White Box) + Specification Based Testing (Black Box) + Bug Report
4. Lab 04: Code Coverage (Line, Branch, Condition)
5. Lab 05: Web Testing (Testing google and uvic home page)
6. Lab 06: Testing Double (Dummy, stub, fake, mock and spy) 
7. Lab 07: Property Testing
- Property Testing (Testing 1000's of inputs at one run) 
- (Adding Pre / Post asserts + invariants (in place of post asserts is state same) in the method of SUT (System under Test))
9. Lab 08: Manual + Regression Testing
- Manual Testing (Playing with Software to find bugs)
- Regression Testing (Testing the next version of already tested software; and check if developer has fixed the bugs suggested; and whether the functionality of software remains same even after fixing the bugs)
